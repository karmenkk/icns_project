He looked up to see where it came from in time to see a young woman looking down.     \"Is this yours?\" he asked.     She said, \"Yes, could you bring it up?\" and the man agreed.     On arrival she was profuse in her thanks and offered the man a drink. As she was very attractive he agreed. Shortly afterwards she said, \"I'm about to have dinner. There's plenty. Would you like to join me?\"     He readily accepted her offer and both enjoyed a lovely meal. As the evening was drawing to a close the lady said, \"I've had a marvelous evening. Would you like to stay the night?\"     The man hesitated then said, \"Do you act like this with every m...  \n",

       "674   A Marine was coming home from the Pentagon one day. He noticed that there was a lot more traffic than normal. As he got further up the road all of the traffic had come to a halt. He saw a policeman coming towards his car, so he asked the cop what was wrong. The cop said, \"Man we are in a crisis situation. Mr. Clinton is in the road very upset. He does not have the $33.5 million that he owes his lawyers, and his family hates him. He is threatening to douse himself in gasoline and start a fire.\" The marine asked the cop exactly what he was doing there. The cop said, \"I feel sorry for the president so I am going car to car asking for donations.\" The marine asked, \"How much do you have so far?\" The cop replied, \"Well as of right now only 33 gallons, but many people are still siphoning as w...  \n",
       "2916  Most people assume WWJD is for \"What would Jesus do?\"  But the initials really stand for \"What would Jesus drive?\"    One theory is that Jesus would tool around in an old Plymouth because the Bible says \"God drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden in a Fury.\"    But in Psalm 83, the Almighty clearly owns a Pontiac and a Geo. The passage urges the Lord to \"pursue your enemies with your Tempest and terrify them with your Storm.\"    Perhaps God favors Dodge pickup trucks, because Moses' followers are warned not to go up a mountain \"until the Ram's horn sounds a long blast.\"    Some scholars insist that Jesus drove a Honda but didn't like to talk about it.  As proof, they cite a verse in St. John's gospel where Christ tells the crowd, \"For I did  not speak of my own Accord...\"     Mea...  \n",
