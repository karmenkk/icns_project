The man insisted, and since the doctor just happened to have a brand new laser device which could zap just the right portions of brain tissue, the operation was planned.  The laser was hooked up to a computer which could monitor the man\\'s declining IQ on a nice bright LED display.  The doctor threw the switch and the numbers began ticking off ... 95, 94, 93, ...  Suddenly the phone rang.  It was the doctor\\'s wife.  They gabbed for a few minutes, the doctor forgetting completely about his patient.  When he hung up, he suddenly realized, and ran into the operating room, only to see the meter tick down ...  6, 5, 4, ...  He ran to the machine and threw the on/off switch, just as the laser was about to wipe out the last remnant of brain.  \"Holy moley!\" exclaimed the doctor, \"What have I done?  Speak to me.

Now don't ask me about it anymore!\\\"Later that afternoon, he was on his way out to get dinner in a nearby town. As he was leaving, his grandfather's dog started to growl and wouldn't let him pass so he said, \\\"Grandfather, your dog won't let me out\\\".Without diverting his attention from the football game he was watching on TV his grandfather shouted, \\\"Cold Water, Go lay down!\\\"\", \"A man is walking down the street when he sees a sign in the window of a travel agency that says CRUISES - $100.

Out comes the Russian competitor, he skates around to some classical music in a slightly dull costume, performs some excellent leaps but without any great artistic feel for the music.   The Judges' scores read: Britain 5.8: Russia 5.9: United States 5.5: Ireland 6.0   Next comes the American competitor in a sparkling stars and stripes costume, skating to some rock and roll music. He gets the crowd clapping, but is not technically as good as the Russian. He slightly misses landing a triple Salchow and loses the center during a spin. But, artistically, it is a more satisfying performance.   The Judges' scores read: Britain 5.8: Russia 5.5: United States 5.9: Ireland 6.0   Finally out comes the Irish competitor wearing a tatty old donkey jacket, with his skates tied over his wellies. He reaches the ice, trips straight away and bangs his nose which starts bleeding. He tries to get up, staggers a few paces then slips again. He spends his entire 'routine' getting up then falling over again. Finally he crawls off the ice a tattered and bleeding mess.   The Judges' scores read: Britain 0.0: Russia 0.0: United States 0.0: Ireland 6.0   The other 3 judges turn to the Irish judge and demand in unison, \\\"How the hell can you give that mess 6.0?!\\\"   To which the Irish judge replies \\\"You've gotta remember, it's damn slippery out there.\\\"\", \"Three athletes were standing in line waiting to enter the Olympic Village.

It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal.   Before the final match, the American wrestler's trainer came to him and said, \\\"Now don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a match because of this \\\"pretzel\\\" hold he has. Whatever you do, don't let him get you in this hold! If he does, you're finished!\\\"   The wrestler nodded in agreement. Now, to the match The American and the Russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold! A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the ending.   Suddenly there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The Russian's back hit the mat with a thud, and the American weakly collapsed on top of him, getting the pin and winning the match.   The trainer was astounded! When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asks, \\\"How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!\\\" The wrestler answered, \\\"Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face.   \\\"I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could.   \\\"You'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls!\\\"\", \"Golfer: \\\"I've played so poorly all day; I think I'm going to go drown myself in that lake.\\\"Caddy: \\\"I doubt you could keep your head down that long.\\\"Golfer: \\\"I'd move heaven and earth to be able to break 100 on this course.\\\"Caddy: \\\"Try heaven.

The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound. Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one. Moses turned to Jesus and said, \\\"I hate playing with your Dad.\\\"\", \"A blonde wanted to go ice fishing.

Again, from the heavens, the voice bellowed, \\\"THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE!\\\" The Blonde, now quite worried, moved way down tothe opposite end of the ice, set up her stool, and tried again to cut her hole.

Seeing it was a fair-sized gorilla tearing the shingles off his home, he promptly called up the local zoo authorities to inform them one of their animals had escaped. He was reassured that a gorilla recovering units was on the way and to remain calm. A few minutes later, an old beat up truck, displaying the Gorilla recovery unit logo on its panels, pulled up to the house. The elderly driver proceeds to recover from the back of the truck, a chihuahua dog, a pair of handcuffs, a ladder, a baseball bat, and a 12-gauge shotgun. Puzzled on how this lone elderly was to solve the problem of this gorilla that had by now torn half the roof apart, the chap asked him how he would go about doing this. As he handed him over the 12-gauge shotgun, the zoo employee explained the plan: \\\"First I'll climb up there with the ladder. Then I'll approach the gorilla and knock him off the roof using the baseball bat. As soon as the gorilla hits the ground, the specially trained chihuahua will attack its private parts. When I get back on the ground, the gorilla will have lowered its hands to its groin area to protect itself thus making it easy for me to slip on the handcuffs. Then, I lead him to the truck, lock him up and take him back to the zoo...\\\" Amazed at the procedure, the somewhat startled house owner asked why he was handed the 12-gauge shotgun? \\\"Well,\\\" explained the experienced gorilla retriever, \\\"It's just a precaution should things not go exactly as planned. In the unlikely event that once on the roof, the gorilla knocks me off with the baseball, shoot the dog.\\\".\", \"One day a man and his wife are playing golf at their home course. On a certain par four, the man tees it up and hits a big slice into the woods.  They find his ball directly behind one of the greenskeeper's buildings where equipment is stored, so that he can't play toward the green at all.  \\\"Damn!\\\" the man says, \\\"I'll have to play sideways to get back on the fairway. I'll make five at best.\\\"  But his wife, who had been looking things over, said \\\"Look, this shed has double doors at both ends. If we open them up, you can hit a low shot right through the building toward the green.\\\"  The man congratulated his wife on her cleverness and they set up for the shot. But the ball hit the top of the far doorframe and came whistling back, striking his wife in the temple and killing her dead on the spot.  A year or so later, the same man was playing the same par 4 and hit his tee shot in almost exactly the same spot as before, right behind the building.

We are OK.  Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away.  Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast.  I got to ride in one of the search & rescue jeeps. It was neat.  We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.  Scoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone.  Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him.  Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up?  The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did.  Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back.  We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck.  The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it.  We think it's a neat car.  He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car.  He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us.  Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy.  Don't worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive.  But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic.  All we ever see up there are logging trucks.  This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake.  Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake.  It was great.  You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood.  Scoutmaster Webb isn't crabby like some scoutmasters.  He didn't even get mad about the life jackets.  He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble.  Guess what?  We have all passed our first aid merit badges.  When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works.  Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken, he said they got sick that way with the food they ate in prison.  I'm so glad he got out and become our scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing his time.  I have to go now.

As he does so, two tees fall out of his shirt pocket onto the ground. \\\"What are those?\\\" asks the attendant. \\\"They're called tees\\\" replies Tiger. \\\"Well, what on the good earth are they for?\\\" inquires the Irishman. \\\"They're for resting my balls on when I'm driving\\\" says Tiger. \\\"Frickin 'eck\\\" says the Irishman, \\\"BMW thinks of everything!\\\".\", \"Beckham went into training one day and saw Owen with a thermo-flask.

The leprechaun then asks, \\\"How's your sex life doing?\\\" The golfer replies, \\\"In all honesty, I haven't had any in years.\\\" So, the leprechaun zaps him with another spell. The golfer goes on to have his best round ever.     Two months later the golfer is playing the same course. He checks to see if the leprechaun is still around. Sure enough, he spots him in the woods.

After another 6 months, they received another letter reminding them of the previous letter and demanding action.

She said \\\"Good, I'll be there at 6:30 or quarter to seven.\\\"     She showed up right at 6:30, and wound up setting a course record with a 7-under-par round.

The guys happily invited her back the next week and she said \\\"Sure, I'll be here at 6:30 or quarter to 7.\\\"     Again, she showed up at 6:30 Sunday morning. Only this time, she played left-handed, and matched her 7-under par score of the previous week. By now the guys were totally amazed, and they asked her to join the group for keeps.     They had a beer after their round, and one of the guys asked her, \\\"how do you know if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?\\\"     She said \\\"That's easy.

While playing on the front nine, he thought over his impending speech and became confused as to where he was on the course. Looking around, he saw a lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her, explained the situation and asked her if she knew what hole he was playing. She replied, \\\"I'm on the 7th hole and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole.\\\"     He thanked her and went back to his golf.     On the back nine the same thing happened and he approached her again with the same request. She said, \\\"I'm on the 14th, you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 13th.\\\"     Once again he thanked her and returned to his play. He finished his round and went into the club house where he saw the lady sitting at the end of the bar. He asked the bartender if he knew the lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often. He approached her and said, \\\"Let me buy you a drink in appreciation for your help. I understand you are in the sales profession. I'm in sales also. What do you sell?\\\"    She replied, \\\"If I told you, you would only laugh.\\\"     \\\"No I wouldn't.\\\"     \\\"Well if you must know\\\", she answered, \\\"I sell sanitary towels.\\\"     She said, \\\"See I knew you would laugh.\\\"     \\\"That's not what I'm laughing at\\\" he replied, \\\"I'm a toilet paper salesman, so I'm still a hole behind you!\\\"\", \"The lady golfer was a determined, if not very proficient player.

Play it as it lays.\\\" So Ralph drives Bill up to his ball in front of the green, drops him off and drives over to his ball on the cart path. Bill watches in amusement as sparks shower down from the practice swings of his opponent, then, in amazement as a perfectly struck shot lands on the green and rolls to within 3 ft. of the pin. Ralph drives back to the green.     Bill says, \\\"Great shot back there!

Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him.    To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time.    Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball - and directly between his ball and the green.     After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, \\\"You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree.\\\"     With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay.

With an NBA player's strike against the team owners looming, now is the time for us to show the world just how much we care. It's just not right. Hundreds of basketball players in our very own country are living at or just below the seven-figure salary level! Atrocious! And, as if that weren't bad enough, they will be deprived of pay for several weeks - possibly a whole year - as a result of the strike. But now you can help! For about two thousand dollars a day - that's less than the cost of a large screen projection TV - you can help a basketball player remain economically viable during his time of need.    Two thousand dollars a day may not seem like a lot of money to you, but to a basketball player it could mean the difference between a vacation spent golfing in Florida or a Mediterranean cruise. For you, two thousand dollars is nothing more than three months rent or mortgage payments, but to a basketball player, two thousand dollars a day will almost replace his salary.    Your commitment of two thousand dollars a day will enable a player to buy that home entertainment center, trade in the year-old Lexus for a new Ferrari, or enjoy a weekend in Rio.    \\\"HOW WILL I KNOW I'M HELPING?\\\"    Each month, you will receive a complete financial report on the player you sponsor. Detailed information about his stocks, bonds, 401(k), real estate, and other investment holdings will be mailed to your home. You'll also get information on how he plans to invest the $5 million lump sum he will receive upon retirement. Plus upon signing up for this program, you will receive a photo of the player (unsigned). Put the photo on your refrigerator to remind you of other peoples' suffering.    \\\"HOW WILL HE KNOW I'M HELPING\\\"    Your basketball player will be told that he has a SPECIAL FRIEND who just wants to help in a time of need. Although the player won't know your name, he will be able to make collect calls to your home via a special operator just in case additional funds are needed for unexpected expenses.

This law does not expire on the 18th hole, since it has the supernatural tendency to extend over the course of a tournament, a summer and, eventually, a lifetime.    LAW 2: Your best round of golf will be followed almost immediately by your worst round ever. The probability of the latter increases with the number of people you tell about the former.    LAW 3: Brand new golf balls are water-magnetic. Though this cannot be proven in the lab, it is a known fact that the more expensive the golf ball, the greater its attraction to water.    LAW 4: Golf balls never bounce off of trees back into play. If one does, the tree is breaking a law of the universe and should be cut down.    LAW 5: No matter what causes a golfer to muff a shot, all his playing partners must solemnly chant, \\\"You looked up,\\\" or invoke the wrath of the universe.    LAW 6: The higher a golfer's handicap, the more qualified he deems himself as an instructor.    LAW 7: Every par-three hole in the world has a secret desire to humiliate golfers. The shorter the hole, the greater its desire.    LAW 8: Topping a 3-iron is the most painful torture known to man.    LAW 9: Palm trees eat golf balls.    LAW 10: Sand is alive. If it isn't, how do you explain the way it works against you?    LAW 11: Golf carts always run out of juice at the farthest point from the clubhouse.    LAW 12: A golfer hitting into your group will always be bigger than anyone in your group. Likewise, a group you accidentally hit into will consist of a football player, a professional wrestler, a convicted murderer and an IRS agent - or some similar combination.    LAW 13: All 3-woods are demon-possessed.    LAW 14: Golf balls from the same, \\\"sleeve\\\" tend to follow one another, particularly out of bounds or into the water (See Law three).    LAW 15: A severe slice is a thing of awesome power and beauty.    LAW 16, \\\"Nice lag\\\" can usually be translated to, \\\"lousy putt.\\\" Similarly, \\\"tough break\\\" can usually be translated, \\\"way to miss an easy one, sucker.\\\"    LAW 17: The person you would most hate to lose to will always be the one who beats you.    LAW 18: The last three holes of a round will automatically adjust your score to what it really should be.    LAW 19: Golf should be given up at least twice per month.

When you leave the 10-pin and you know you can't make the spare, but another member of your team can, invoke the \\\"Designated Bowler\\\" rule.     After you have 4 splits in one game, you may say \\\"Kings X\\\" and take those 4 frames over. However, if you split on the 2nd time around, you accept it. After all, \\\"Fair is Fair\\\".     If your ball goes in the gutter and jumps back onto the lane, knocking dow pins, by golly, you get them! That's much harder than to knock them down the conventional way.
