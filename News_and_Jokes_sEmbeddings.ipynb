full of money parked behind the bar. you can also make bets at this stage, because of course, you are still smart, so naturally you win all your bets. it doesn't matter how much you bet 'cos you are rich.  you will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because now you are the best looking person in the world. stage 4 - bullet proof  you are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone

are also invisible to the person who wants to fight you. you can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still smart you know all

program is called screw.    screw (survey of capabilities of retired early workers). all employees who have been slapped and screwed may file an appeal with upper management.    this appeal is called

required prior to entering myass. this database will encompass all information associated with the business.   as you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in myass. as myass grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, \\\"here, stick this in myass.\\\" it will be a great day when we need data quickly

would take care of it. the next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out. the next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt. finally giving in, he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. the computer duly processed

  because that's the way they built them in england, and the us railroads were built by english expatriates. why did the english people build them like that? because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. why did \\\"they\\\" use that gauge then? because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagons would break on the old long distance roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts. so who built these old rutted roads? the first long distance roads in europe were built by   imperial rome for the benefit of their legions. the roads have been used ever since. and the ruts? the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by roman war chariots.   since the chariots were made for or by imperial rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. thus, we have the answer to the original questions. the united states standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches   derives from the original specification for an imperial roman army war chariot. specs and bureaucracies live forever. so, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's behind came up with it, you   may be exactly right. because the imperial roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two warhorses.\", \"google products we'll never see    11. google hitman assistant - find, schedule, and collect on all your assassinations with this suite of products.    10. googlearchy - tired of democracy?

motion he meant movement, and not the rude kind that involves bowels but the newtonian kind. he did this by the achilles (a) and the tortoise (t) parable. for argument's sake, say a runs 10 times faster than t can crawl. then let t be placed 10 meters ahead of a at the start of a race. when a has moved 10 meters, t has moved 1 meter, so t is now still 1 meter ahead of a. then when a has covered that 1 meter, t has gone 1/10 meter ahead. etc. so, a will never ever pass t. poor zeno, it was reported that he found this logic so persuasive that he did not bother to move again, a kind of ontological constipation perhaps?    but the naughty version of it is a bit sexist (feminists, please reverse male and female roles in this story!). it goes like this. a psychologist wanted to test the difference in logical thinking between engineering and mathematics majors, and for this purpose he set up an experiment in which the subjects were respectively a male mathematics and a randy male engineering undergraduate. he showed them into the lab. at the far end of the long, narrow room was a luscious semi-clad bimbo. his instructions were like so: \\\"fellas, i have in my hands a buzzer that i will sound every minute. every time i do that, you can walk half the distance that remains between yourself and the lady. should you ever reach her, you will find her most accommodating. do you wish to participate in the experimemt?\\\"    math major: \\\"you don't fool me. this is the equivalent of the zeno paradox, so i am not wasting my time. i am going home, 'bye.\\\" [exeunt]  engineering major: \\\"hee, hee! i am staying. i estimate that in 10 minutes, i will be close enough for all practical purposes.\\\"\", \"is zero a 1-digit number or a 0-digit number, or neither?     you may think that 0 is a 1-digit number. however, this will make 00 a 2-digit number, 000 a 3-digit number, and so on. leading zeros do not count towards the digits, and 0 itself is a leading zero.    if you think that 0 is a 0-digit number, you're still wrong. 100 is a 3-digit number, 10 is a 2-digit number, 1 is a 1-digit number, and therefore, .1 is a 0-digit number, .01 is a -1-digit number, and so on. therefore, the number of digits of a real number x is 1+int(lgx). since lg0 is meaningless, the number of digits of 0 can't be defined.\", \"there was a mad scientist (a mad ...social...

whatever you do, don't let him get you in this hold! if he does, you're finished!\\\"   the wrestler nodded in agreement. now, to the match the american and the russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. all of a sudden the russian lunged forward, grabbing the american and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold! a sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. he couldn't watch the ending.   suddenly there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the russian flying up in the air. the russian's back hit the mat with a thud, and the american weakly collapsed on top of him, getting the pin and winning the match.   the trainer was astounded!

got me in that hold, but at the last moment, i opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face.   \\\"i thought i had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength i stretched

hazard. it landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. the third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. it headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. it bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. from there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. on the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. as

which case, you can renege on the \\\"overs\\\".     when your team is about 10 marks down in the 8th or 9th frame, you can invoke the rule \\\"first team through bowling wins the game\\\", and your team still has a chance.     after a member of the opposing team bowls 4 strikes in a row, he/she must bowl the next 4 frames blindfolded. if he/she continues to strike, his/her shoelaces will be tied together for 2 frames.     when you leave the 10-pin and you know you can't make the spare, but another member of your team can, invoke the \\\"designated bowler\\\" rule.     after you have 4 splits in one game, you may say \\\"kings x\\\" and take those 4 frames over. however, if you split on the 2nd time around, you accept it. after all, \\\"fair is fair\\\".     if your ball goes in the gutter and jumps back onto the lane, knocking dow pins, by golly, you get them! that's much harder than to knock them down the conventional way. good bowling should be recognized.     a ball should be declared dead when you bowl 3 games without a strike. it shall be the owners privilege to decide on the disposition of said dead ball - burial at sea, dropped from an airplane over a live volcano, or

it to him, then jumped back on the chair. the manager  was stunned, but then told the dog, \\\"the sign says you have to be  good with a computer.\\\"  the dog jumped down again and went to the computer. the dog proceeded to enter and execute a perfect program, that worked flawlessly the first time it ran.  by now, the manager was totally dumb-founded! he looked at the dog  and said, \\\"i

said \\\"meow.\\\"\", \"how to tell you need a new secretary\", \"ames, ia--the heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by materials researchers at iprt/isu. the new element, tentatively named administratium, has no protons or electrons, and thus has an atomic weight of 0. however, it does have one neuron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. this gives it an atomic mass of 312. these 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons.  since it has no electrons, administratium is totally inert. however, it can be detected chemically, since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with. according to its discovers, a tiny amount of administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete; the normal reaction time is less than one second.  administratium has a normal half life of approximately three years, at which time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization.  research at other laboratories indicates that administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. it tends to concentrate at certain points, such as governmental agencies, large corporations, and universities. it is always found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.  scientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate. attempts are being made to determine how administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.\", \"a feisty 70 year old woman had to call a furnace repairman. after a quick inspection the man put some oil into the motor and handed her

immediately, a restroom trip policy will be established to provide a more consistent method of accounting for each employee's restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of all employees.  under the policy a \\\"restroom trip bank\\\" will be established for each employee. the first day of each month, employees will be given twenty restroom trip credits. these credits may be accumulated.  within four to six weeks, the entrance doors to all restrooms are being equipped with personal identification stations and computer-linked voice print recognition devices. before the end of the month each employee must provide two copies of voice prints (one normal and one under stress) to the human resources department. the voice print recognition station will be operational but not restrictive during the entire month. employees should acquaint themselves with the stations during that period.  if the employee's restroom trip bank balance reaches zero, the doors to the restrooms will not unlock for that employee's voice until the first of the next month. in addition, all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper roll retractors. if the stall is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will sound. thirty-seconds after the alarm sounds, the roll of paper will retract into the wall, the toilet will flush, and the stall door will open. if the stall remains occupied, your picture will be taken.  the picture will then be posted on the bulletin board located in the employee relations office. anyone's picture showing up three times will immediately be terminated. if you have any

individual to be the subject of technical harassment. sometimes it can be so subtle that you may not even be aware you are being harassed. worse yet, you may inadvertently technically harass another person by accident.  following are some guidelines to help you determine if you are being technically harassed.  if you are repeatedly asked the same technical question you may be the victim of technical harassment.  while it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation, some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment.  habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of a group may ask the same question repeatedly.  untreated, these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years.  if you are asked a technical question by a non-technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous.  most non-technical people are not capable of remembering a true technical answer for more than 30 seconds.  if you are forced into a discussion where a person uses more than three (3) buzzwords in one sentence the person is most likely a fake and you are the unwitting victim of technical harassment.  one note of caution, competent technical people have been known to inadvertently use buzzwords after reading mindless drivel like pc week or lan times.  if the person has been known to use more common technical terms in the past such as \\\"stuff\\\" and \\\"things\\\", they are most likely victim of computer magazine brainwashing.  if during a troubleshooting session a person uses the term \\\"trick\\\".  for example \\\"maybe we could trick the database into thinking it has been updated\\\". this is a sure sign of technical harassment.  if a person explains that a needed feature will be provided by a vendor and that person is nontechnical then you are at risk of being technically harassed. if you believe that person, you have definitely been technically harassed, if you don't believe them you have only been technically annoyed.  if when trying to resolve a technical problem with a product from a vendor and you are instructed to call the salesman that sold us the product you are being set up for technical harassment.  it is a common reaction for a non-technical person when they have purchased technical equipment to call another non-technical person.  the dialogue between two nontechnical people usually provides some sense of comfort that they aren't the only ones who are confused.\", \"a business man was interviewing applicants for the position of divisional manager. he devised a simple test to select the most suitable person for the job. he asked each

person in the entire bar and that people fancy you. you can go up to a perfect stranger knowing they fancy you and really want to talk to you. bear in mind that you are still smart, so you can talk to

full of money parked behind the bar. you can also make bets at this stage, because of course, you are still smart, so naturally you win all your bets. it doesn't matter how much you bet 'cos you are rich.  you will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because now you are the best looking person in the world. stage 4 - bullet proof  you are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone

are also invisible to the person who wants to fight you. you can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still smart you know all

personnel.    under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately.    this program will be known as slap (sever late-aged personnel). employees who are slapped will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company.    slapped employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. this review phase of the program is called screw.    screw (survey of capabilities of retired early workers). all employees who have been slapped and screwed may file an appeal with upper management.    this appeal is called shaft (study by higher authority following termination).    under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be slapped once, screwed twice, but may be shafted as many times as the company deems appropriate.    if an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: herpes (half earnings for retired personnel's early severance) or clap (combined lump sum assistance payment).    as herpes and clap are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received herpes or clap will no longer be slapped or screwed by the company.    management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our:    special high intensity training (shit). we take pride in the amount of shit our employees receive. we have given our employees more shit than any company in this area. if any employee feels they do not receive enough shit on the job, see your immediate supervisor.    your supervisor is specially trained to make sure you receive all the shit you can stand.    and, once again, thanks for all your years of service with us.\", \"an astronaut in space was asked by a

actually looking forward to doing it again, and was even ready to kiss myass.   there have been concerns over the virus that was found in myass upon initial installation, but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save myass. in the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering myass. this database will encompass all information associated with the business.   as you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in myass. as myass grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say,

ignored it and threw it away. in april he received another and threw that one away too. the following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn't send them $0.00 by return of post. he called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer error and told him they'd take care of it. the following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament. however, in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been canceled. he called the credit card company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it. the next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out. the next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt. finally giving in, he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. the computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all. a week later, the man's bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for $0.00. after a lengthy explanation the bank replied that the $0.00 check had caused their check processing software to fail. the bank could not now process any checks from any of their customers that day because the check for $0.00 was causing the computer to crash. the following month the man received a letter from the credit card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a check by return of post they would be taking steps to recover the debt. the man, who had been considering buying his wife a computer for her birthday, bought her a

  because that's the way they built them in england, and the us railroads were built by english expatriates. why did the english people build them like that? because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. why did \\\"they\\\" use that gauge then? because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagons would break on the old long distance roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts. so who built these old rutted roads? the first long distance roads in europe were built by   imperial rome for the benefit of their legions. the roads have been used ever since. and the ruts? the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by roman war chariots.   since the chariots were made for or by imperial rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. thus, we have the answer to the original questions. the united states standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches   derives from the original specification for an imperial roman army war chariot. specs and bureaucracies live forever. so, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's behind came up with it, you   may be exactly right. because the imperial roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two warhorses.\", \"google products we'll never see    11. google hitman assistant - find, schedule, and collect on all your assassinations with this suite of products.    10. googlearchy - tired of democracy?

faster than t can crawl. then let t be placed 10 meters ahead of a at the start of a race. when a has moved 10 meters, t has moved 1 meter, so t is now still 1 meter ahead of a. then when a has covered that 1 meter, t has gone 1/10 meter ahead. etc. so, a will never ever pass t. poor zeno, it was reported that he found this logic so persuasive that he did not bother to move again, a kind of

hits the ground, the specially trained chihuahua will attack its private parts. when i get back on the ground, the gorilla will have lowered its hands to its groin area to protect itself thus making

in one game, you may say \\\"kings x\\\" and take those 4 frames over. however, if you split on the 2nd time around, you accept it. after all, \\\"fair is fair\\\".     if your ball goes in the gutter

enough to support my family's needs.\\\" the american then asked, \\\"but what do you do with the rest of your time?\\\"   the mexican fisherman said, \\\"i sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, maria, stroll into the village each evening where i sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, i have a full and busy life.\\\"  the american scoffed, \\\"i am a harvard mba and could help you. you should spend more time fishing; and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat: with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor; eventually opening your own cannery. you would control the product, processing and distribution. you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to mexico city, then los angeles and eventually new york where you will run your ever-expanding enterprise.\\\"  the mexican fisherman asked, \\\"but, how long will this all take?\\\" to which the american replied, \\\"15 to 20 years.\\\" \\\"but what then?\\\" asked the mexican. the american laughed and said that's the best part. \\\"when the time is right you would announce an ipo and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.\\\"   \\\"millions?...then what?\\\" the

tentatively named administratium, has no protons or electrons, and thus has an atomic weight of 0. however, it does have one neuron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. this gives it an atomic mass of 312. these 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons.  since it has no electrons, administratium is totally inert. however, it can be detected chemically, since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with. according to its discovers, a tiny amount of administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete; the normal reaction time is less than one second.  administratium has a normal half life of approximately three years, at which time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization.  research at other laboratories indicates that administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. it tends to concentrate at certain points, such as governmental agencies, large corporations, and universities. it is always found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.  scientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate. attempts are being made to determine how administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.\", \"a feisty 70 year old woman had to call a furnace repairman. after a quick inspection the man put some oil into the motor and handed her

policy a \\\"restroom trip bank\\\" will be established for each employee. the first day of each month, employees will be given twenty restroom trip credits. these credits may be accumulated.  within four to six weeks, the entrance doors to all restrooms are being equipped with personal identification stations and computer-linked voice print recognition devices. before the end of the month each employee must provide two copies of voice prints (one normal and one under stress) to the human resources department. the voice print recognition station will be operational but not restrictive during the entire month. employees should acquaint themselves with the stations during that period.  if the employee's restroom trip bank balance reaches zero, the doors to the restrooms will not unlock for that employee's voice until the first of the next month. in addition, all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper roll retractors. if the stall is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will sound. thirty-seconds after the alarm sounds, the roll of paper will retract into the wall, the toilet will flush, and the stall door will open. if the stall remains occupied, your picture

individual to be the subject of technical harassment. sometimes it can be so subtle that you may not even be aware you are being harassed. worse yet, you may inadvertently technically harass another person by accident.  following are some guidelines to help you determine if you are being technically harassed.  if you are repeatedly asked the same technical question you may be the victim of technical harassment.  while it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation, some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment.  habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of a group may ask the same question repeatedly.  untreated, these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years.  if you are asked a technical question by a non-technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous.  most non-technical people are not capable of remembering a true technical answer for more than 30 seconds.  if you are forced into a discussion where a person uses more than three (3) buzzwords in one sentence the person is most likely a fake and you are the unwitting victim of technical harassment.  one note of caution, competent technical people have been known to inadvertently use buzzwords after reading mindless drivel like pc week or lan times.  if the person has been known to use more common technical terms in the past such as \\\"stuff\\\" and \\\"things\\\", they are most likely victim of computer magazine brainwashing.  if during a troubleshooting session a person uses the term \\\"trick\\\".  for example \\\"maybe we could trick the database into thinking it has been updated\\\". this is a sure sign of technical harassment.  if a person explains that a needed feature will be provided by a vendor and that person is nontechnical then you are at risk of being technically harassed. if you believe that person, you have definitely been technically harassed, if you don't believe them you have only been technically annoyed.  if when trying to resolve a technical problem with a product from a vendor and you are instructed to call the salesman that sold us the product you are being set up for technical harassment.  it is a common reaction for a non-technical person when they have purchased technical equipment to call another non-technical person.  the dialogue between two nontechnical people usually provides some sense of comfort that they aren't the only ones who are confused.\", \"a business man was interviewing applicants for the position of divisional manager. he devised a simple test to select the most suitable person for the job. he asked each

argument when both parties are smart. stage 2 - good looking  this is when you realise that you are the best looking person in the entire bar and that people fancy you. you can go up to a perfect stranger knowing they fancy you and really want to talk to you. bear in mind that you are still smart, so you can talk to this person about any subject under the sun. stage 3 - rich  this is when you suddenly become the richest person in the world. you can buy drinks for the entire bar because you have an armoured truck full of money parked behind the bar. you can also make bets at this stage, because of course, you are still smart, so naturally you win all your bets. it doesn't matter how much you bet 'cos you are rich.  you will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because now you are the best looking person in the world. stage 4 - bullet proof  you are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone especially those with whom you have been betting or arguing. this is because nothing can hurt you. at this point you can also go up to the partners of the people who you fancy and challenge to a battle of wits or money. you have no fear of losing this battle because you are smart, you are rich and hell, you're better looking than they are anyway! stage 5 - invisible  this is the final stage of drunkenness. at this point you can do anything because no one can see you. you dance on a table to impress the people who you fancy because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you. you are also invisible to the person who wants to fight you. you can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still smart you know all the words.\", \"dr. seuss explains computersif a packet hits a pocket on a socket

new element, tentatively named administratium, has no protons or electrons, and thus has an atomic weight of 0. however, it does have one neuron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. this gives it an atomic mass of 312. these 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons.  since it has no electrons, administratium is totally inert. however, it can be detected chemically, since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with. according to its discovers, a tiny amount of administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete; the normal reaction time is less than one second.  administratium has a normal half life of approximately three years, at which time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization.  research at other laboratories indicates that administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. it tends to concentrate at certain points, such as governmental agencies, large corporations, and universities. it is always found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.  scientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate. attempts are being made to determine how administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.\", \"a feisty 70 year old woman had to call a furnace repairman. after a quick inspection the man put some oil into the motor and handed her

technical harassment.  while it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation, some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment.  habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of a group may ask the same question repeatedly.  untreated, these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years.  if you are asked a technical question by a non-technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous.  most non-technical people are not capable of remembering a true technical answer for more than 30 seconds.  if you are forced into a discussion where a person uses more than three (3) buzzwords in one sentence the person is most likely a fake and you are the unwitting victim of technical harassment.  one note of caution, competent technical people have been known to inadvertently use buzzwords after reading mindless drivel like pc week or lan times.  if the person has been known to use more common technical terms in the past such as \\\"stuff\\\" and \\\"things\\\", they are most likely victim of computer magazine brainwashing.  if during a troubleshooting session a person uses the term \\\"trick\\\".  for example \\\"maybe we could trick the database into thinking it has been updated\\\". this is a sure sign of technical harassment.  if a person explains that a needed feature will be provided by a vendor and that person is nontechnical then you are at risk of being technically harassed. if you believe that person, you have definitely been technically harassed, if you don't believe them you have only been technically annoyed.  if when trying to resolve a technical problem with a product from a vendor and you are instructed to call the salesman that sold us the product you are being set up for technical harassment.  it is a common reaction for a non-technical person when they have purchased technical equipment to call another non-technical person.  the dialogue between two nontechnical people usually provides some sense of comfort that they aren't the only ones who are confused.\", \"a business man was interviewing applicants for the position of divisional manager. he devised a simple test to select the most suitable person for the job. he asked each

club didn't allow women on the golf course. eventually, there was enough pressure that they decided to allow women on the course during the week.     the ladies were satisfied with this arrangement, formed a women's club, and became active. after about 6 months, the club board received a letter from the women's club complaining about the men urinating on the golf course. naturally, they just ignored the matter. after another 6 months, they received another letter reminding them of the previous letter and demanding action. after due deliberation they sent the women a letter advising them

there at 6:30 or quarter to seven.\\\"     she showed up right at 6:30, and wound up setting a course record with a 7-under-par round. the guys went nuts and everyone in the clubhouse congratulated her. meanwhile, she was fun and pleasant the entire round. the guys happily invited her back the next week and she said \\\"sure, i'll be here at 6:30 or quarter to 7.\\\"     again, she showed up at 6:30 sunday morning. only this time, she played left-handed, and matched her 7-under par score of the previous week. by now the guys were totally amazed, and they asked her to join the group for keeps.     they had a beer after their round, and one of the guys asked her, \\\"how do you know if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?\\\"     she said \\\"that's easy. before i leave for the golf course, i pull the covers off my husband, who sleeps in the nude. if his member is pointing to the right, i golf right-handed; if it's pointed to the left, i golf left-handed.\\\"     a

impending speech and became confused as to where he was on the course. looking around, he saw a lady playing ahead of him. he walked up to her, explained the situation and asked her if she knew what hole he was playing. she replied, \\\"i'm on the 7th hole and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole.\\\"     he thanked her and went back to his golf.     on the back nine the same thing happened and he approached her again with the same request. she said, \\\"i'm on the 14th, you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 13th.\\\"     once again he thanked her and returned to his play. he finished his round and went into the club house where he saw the lady sitting at the end of the bar. he asked the bartender if he knew the lady. the bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often. he approached her and said, \\\"let me buy you a drink in appreciation for your help. i understand you are in the sales profession. i'm in sales also. what do you

old man played fairly quickly. he didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time.    finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. there was a large pine tree right in front of his ball - and directly between his ball and the green.     after several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, \\\"you know, when i was your age i'd hit the ball right over that tree.\\\"     with that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree

the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately.    this program will be known as slap (sever late-aged personnel). employees who are slapped will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company.    slapped employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. this review phase of the program is called screw.    screw (survey of capabilities of retired early workers). all employees who have been slapped and screwed may file an appeal with upper management.    this appeal is called shaft (study by higher authority following termination).    under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be slapped once, screwed twice, but may be shafted as many times as the company deems appropriate.    if an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: herpes (half earnings for retired personnel's early severance) or clap (combined lump sum assistance payment).    as herpes and clap are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received herpes or clap will no longer be slapped or screwed by the company.    management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our:    special high intensity training (shit). we take pride in the amount of shit our employees receive. we have given

yet known to science. the new element has been named \\\"government.\\\"     governmentium (gv) has one neutron, 25 assistant neutrons, 88 deputy neutrons, and 198 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 312.     these 312 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton like particles called peons. since gv has no electrons, it is inert. however, it can be detected, because it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. a minute amount of gv causes one reaction to take over four days to complete, when it would normally take less than a second!     gv has a normal half-life of 4 years; it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and deputy neutrons exchange places. in fact, governmentium's mass will actually increase over time, since each reorganization will cause more morons to become neutrons, forming isodopes.     this characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to believe that gv is formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. this hypothetical quantity is referred to as critical morass.     when catalyzed with money, gv becomes administratium (am) - an element which radiates just as much energy as gv since it has half as many peons but twice as many morons.\", \"delete this now!\", \"a man was filling

available as fru (field replacement units).    therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.    before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls. ball removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method. domestic balls are replaced by the twist-off method. mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. however, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.    upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse can be used immediately.    it is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.    any customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of

the party!    seriously, we can appreciate how a luncheon at this time of year does not accommodate our muslim employees' beliefs. perhaps the grill house can hold off on serving your meal until the end of the party - or else package everything for you to take it home in little foil doggy bags.    will that work? meanwhile, i've arranged for members of weight watchers to sit farthest from the dessert buffet, and pregnant women will get the table closest to the restrooms. gays are allowed to sit with each other.    lesbians do not have to sit with gay men and vice versa; each will have their own table. yes, there will be flower arrangements for the gay men's table. to the person asking permission to cross-dress, no cross-dressing allowed.     we will have booster seats for short people. low-fat food will be available for those on a diet. we cannot control the salt used in the food. we suggest for those people with high blood pressure to taste before you eat.    there will be fresh fruits as dessert for diabetics; the restaurant cannot supply \\\"no sugar\\\" desserts. sorry! did i miss anything?    patty          (continuation is wocka joke:  december 10th.)\", \"(to

railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. that's an exceedingly odd number. why was that gauge used?   because that's the way they built them in england, and the us railroads were built by english expatriates. why did the english people build them like that? because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. why did \\\"they\\\" use that gauge then? because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagons would break on the old long distance roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts. so who built these old rutted roads? the first long distance roads in europe were built by   imperial rome for the benefit of their legions. the roads have been used ever since. and the ruts? the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by roman war chariots.   since the chariots were made for or by imperial rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. thus, we have the answer to the original questions. the united states standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches   derives from the original specification for an imperial roman army war chariot. specs and bureaucracies live forever. so, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's behind came up with it, you   may be exactly right. because the imperial roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two warhorses.\", \"two saudis emigrated to america with their families.  on the plane ride over they made a
