"A brunette, a blonde, and a redhead all worked in the same office with the same female boss. Every day, they noticed their boss left work early.  One day, the girls decided that when the boss left, they'd leave right behind her. After all, she never called in or came back to the office when she left early, so how was she to know?  The next day, they all three left the office right after the boss left. The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening and went to bed early.  The redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the health club before meeting her dinner date.  The blonde was happy, happy, happy to be home, but when she got to the bedroom she heard a muffled noise from inside. Slowly, quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband in bed with HER BOSS.  Ever so gently, she closed the door and crept out of her house. The next day at coffee break, the brunette and redhead decided they were leaving early again, and asked the blonde if she was coming with them.

"Dear Sir or Madam;  While working with Mr. Smith, I have always found him working studiously and sincerely at his table without idling or gossiping with colleagues in the office. He seldom wastes his time on useless things. Given a job, he always finishes the given assignment in time.

For three days, the African ambassador was wined, dined, and generally treated to the best hospitality that Russia had to offer.

""Look!"" he hissed, then swinging his legs over a metal pipe, hung upside down.  Within seconds, the Director emerged from the Branch Head's office at the far end of the floor. He saw the worker hanging from the ceiling, and asked him what on earth he thought he was doing.  ""I'm a light bulb"" answered the public servant.

"One day, down in the mystical forest, a magical frog was hopping towards a water hole. The forest was so enormous that the frog had never laid eyes on another animal before. But today, by chance a bear was chasing after a rabbit to have for dinner.   The frog called for the two to stop and said, ""Because you are the only two animals I have seen, I will grant both of you three wishes. Bear, you can go first."" The bear thought for a moment, and being the male he was, said, ""I wish for all the bears in this forest, apart from me, to be female.""   For his wish, the rabbit asked for a crash helmet, and immediately put it on. The bear was amazed at the stupidity of the rabbit, wasting his wish like that.   It was the bear's second turn for a wish. ""Well, I wish that all the bears in the next forest were female as well.""   The rabbit asked for a motorcycle and immediately hopped on it and roared the engine. The bear was shocked that the rabbit was asking for such idiotic items, because after all, he could have asked for money and bought the bike.

"Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound. Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one. Moses turned to Jesus and said, ""I hate playing with your Dad.""",Sports,stupidstuff,4.8,313

"As he was quietly watching television at home, the chap heard a sound on the roof of his house and rushed out to investigate. Seeing it was a fair-sized gorilla tearing the shingles off his home, he promptly called up the local zoo authorities to inform them one of their animals had escaped. He was reassured that a gorilla recovering units was on the way and to remain calm.

The elderly driver proceeds to recover from the back of the truck, a chihuahua dog, a pair of handcuffs, a ladder, a baseball bat, and a 12-gauge shotgun. Puzzled on how this lone elderly was to solve the problem of this gorilla that had by now torn half the roof apart, the chap asked him how he would go about doing this. As he handed him over the 12-gauge shotgun, the zoo employee explained the plan: ""First I'll climb up there with the ladder. Then I'll approach the gorilla and knock him off the roof using the baseball bat. As soon as the gorilla hits the ground, the specially trained chihuahua will attack its private parts. When I get back on the ground, the gorilla will have lowered its hands to its groin area to protect itself thus making it easy for me to slip on the handcuffs. Then, I lead him to the truck, lock him up and take him back to the zoo..."" Amazed at the procedure, the somewhat startled house owner asked why he was handed the 12-gauge shotgun?

"This memo is to announce the development of a new software system which will be Year 2000 compliant. This program is known as ""Millennia Year Application Software System"" (MYASS).  Next Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS to everyone. We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at MYASS. We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands.   Some employees have begun using the program already. This morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS. Some of the less technical people may be somewhat afraid of MYASS. Last week my secretary said to me, ""I'm a little nervous, I never put anything in MYASS before."" I helped her through the first time and afterward she admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again, and was even ready to kiss MYASS.   There have been concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial installation, but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS. In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering MYASS. This database will encompass all information associated with the business.   As you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in MYASS. As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, ""here, stick this in MYASS."" It will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can respond, ""Here it is, I just pulled it out of MYASS.""",Computers,stupidstuff,3.33,371

Osama found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and bred them with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from the litter, and removed his siblings, which gave him all the milk.  After 5 years, they came up with the biggest, meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were 5 "" thick and nobody could get near it.   When the day came for the dog fight, Bush showed up with a strange looking animal. It was a 9 foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for Bush because there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the Afghanistani dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it's cage, and slowly waddled over towards Osama's dog. Osama's dog snarled and leaped out of its cage and charged the American Dachshund---but when it got close enough to bite, the Dachshund opened its mouth and consumed Osama's dog in one bite. There was nothing left of his dog at all.   Osama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, ""We don't understand how this could have happened.  We had our best people working for 5 years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest, meanest Siberian wolves.""   ""That's nothing,"", said Bush.  ""We had Michael Jackson's plastic surgeons working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a weenie dog.""   GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!",Political,stupidstuff,3.5,401

"In March 1992 a man living in Newton near Boston Massachusetts received a bill for his as yet unused credit card stating that he owed $0.00. He ignored it and threw it away. In April he received another and threw that one away too. The following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn't send them $0.00 by return of post. He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer error and told him they'd take care of it. The following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament. However, in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been canceled. He called the credit card company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it. The next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out. The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt. Finally giving in, he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. The computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all. A week later, the man's bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for $0.00.

And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why doth thou travel far, from town to town, with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?""  And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, Dear?"" And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)"".  Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had, at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.  They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short. And lo the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would only work if you bought Brother Gates' drumsticks.  And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others"". And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known, ""eBay,"" he said, ""we need a name of a service that reflects what we are,"" and Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.""

""There is no need for software to be mistreated in this way so that companies like these can market new products,"" said Ken Grandola, spokesperson for PETS. ""Alternative methods of testing these products are available.""  According to PETS, these companies force software to undergo lengthy and arduous tests, often without rest, for hours or days at a time. Employees are assigned to ""break"" the software by any means necessary, and inside sources report that they often joke about ""torturing"" the software.  ""It's no joke,"" said Grandola. ""Innocent programs, from the day they are compiled, are cooped up in tiny rooms and ""crashed"" for hours on end. They spend their whole lives on dirty, ill-maintained computers, and are unceremoniously deleted when they're not needed anymore.""  Grandola said the software is kept in unsanitary conditions and is infested with bugs.  ""We know that alternatives to this horror exist,"" he said, citing industry giant Microsoft Corporation as a company that has become successful without resorting to software testing.",Computers,stupidstuff,2.0,272

President Bush's ""Don't Ask, Just Give 'em Hell"" policy is a sharp departure from former President Clinton's focus on moving the Pentagon to San Francisco and painting Navy battleships a bright lavender.  The President was particularly pleased that it was a 50's era propeller driven plane that took out the Chinese aircraft. ""Heck, we bought and paid for that sucker fifty years ago. It didn't cost the American taxpayer a single dime to take out that commie.""  Bush was also pleased his ""Ram The Bastard"" policy for Navy submarines was a rousing success.

"During his visit to the United States the Pope met with President Clinton. Instead of just an hour, as scheduled, the meeting went on for two days. Finally, a weary President Clinton emerged to face the waiting news media. The President was smiling and announced the summit was a resounding success. He said he and the Pope agreed on 80% of the matters they discussed. Then Mr. Clinton declared he was going home to the White House to be with his family.  A few minutes later, the Pope came out to make his statement. He looked tired, discouraged and was practically in tears. Sadly he announced his meeting with the President was a failure.

"In new documents just revealed by the Justice Department, in addition to the controversial pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, former President Clinton also pardoned Adolph Hitler and Satan. With minutes to go before his term expired, Clinton signed an order to pardon himself.  Clinton's press liaison defended the pardons.  ""President Clinton reasoned it's time to put this whole 'World War' thing behind us.  ""While Hitler did indeed have a few bad years, he's been a model of civility for the last 56 years.  We think he deserves a second chance.""  Clinton seemed to identify with Hitler.  ""There were forces constantly at work against him.  I'm not condoning what he did, mind you, but I feel his pain.  I know exactly what it's like to have the media of the world against you.""  Clinton's pardon of Satan drew some right-wing Republican protests.  Representative Dan Burton called upon Clinton to appear before Congress and explain the action.  Burton believes there was a deal between the Prince of Darkness and Clinton to help build Clinton's Presidential Library in exchange for the pardon and Clinton's soul.  Democrats were quick to dismiss the charges.  Senator Tom Daschle said, ""These charges are bogus because President Clinton sold his soul to Satan years ago.""

"AMES, IA--The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by materials researchers at IPRT/ISU. The new element, tentatively named Administratium, has no protons or electrons, and thus has an atomic weight of 0. However, it does have one neuron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons.  Since it has no electrons, Administratium is totally inert. However, it can be detected chemically, since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with. According to its discovers, a tiny amount of Administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete; the normal reaction time is less than one second.  Administratium has a normal half life of approximately three years, at which time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization.  Research at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points, such as governmental agencies, large corporations, and universities. It is always found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.  Scientists point out that Administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how Administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.",Business,stupidstuff,3.0,348

"FROM: OPERATIONS SUBJECT: Restroom Use Policy  In the past, employees were permitted to make trips to the restroom under informal guidelines. Effective immediately, a Restroom Trip Policy will be established to provide a more consistent method of accounting for each employee's restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of all employees.  Under the policy a ""Restroom Trip Bank"" will be established for each employee. The first day of each month, employees will be given twenty Restroom Trip Credits. These credits may be accumulated.  Within four to six weeks, the entrance doors to all restrooms are being equipped with personal identification stations and computer-linked voice print recognition devices. Before the end of the month each employee must provide two copies of voice prints (one normal and one under stress) to the Human Resources Department. The voice print recognition station will be operational but not restrictive during the entire month. Employees should acquaint themselves with the stations during that period.  If the employee's Restroom Trip Bank balance reaches zero, the doors to the restrooms will not unlock for that employee's voice until the first of the next month. In addition, all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper roll retractors. If the stall is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will sound. Thirty-seconds after the alarm sounds, the roll of paper will retract into the wall, the toilet will flush, and the stall door will open. If the stall remains occupied, your picture will be taken.  The picture will then be posted on the bulletin board located in the Employee Relations Office. Anyone's picture showing up three times will immediately be terminated.

"In our complex technical environment there are many opportunities for a competent technical individual to be the subject of technical harassment. Sometimes it can be so subtle that you may not even be aware you are being harassed. Worse yet, you may inadvertently technically harass another person by accident.  Following are some guidelines to help you determine if you are being technically harassed.  If you are repeatedly asked the same technical question you may be the victim of technical harassment.  While it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation, some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment.  Habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of a group may ask the same question repeatedly.  Untreated, these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years.  If you are asked a technical question by a non-technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous.  Most non-technical people are not capable of remembering a true technical answer for more than 30 seconds.  If you are forced into a discussion where a person uses more than three (3) buzzwords in one sentence the person is most likely a fake and you are the unwitting victim of technical harassment.  One note of caution, competent technical people have been known to inadvertently use buzzwords after reading mindless drivel like PC Week or LAN Times.  If the person has been known to use more common technical terms in the past such as ""stuff"" and ""things"", they are most likely victim of computer magazine brainwashing.  If during a troubleshooting session a person uses the term ""trick"".  For example ""maybe we could trick the database into thinking it has been updated"". This is a sure sign of technical harassment.  If a person explains that a needed feature will be provided by a vendor and that person is nontechnical then you are at risk of being technically harassed. If you believe that person, you have definitely been technically harassed, if you don't believe them you have only been technically annoyed.  If when trying to resolve a technical problem with a product from a vendor and you are instructed to call the salesman that sold us the product you are being set up for technical harassment.  It is a common reaction for a non-technical person when they have purchased technical equipment to call another non-technical person.  The dialogue between two nontechnical people usually provides some sense of comfort that they aren't the only ones who are confused.",Business,stupidstuff,4.0,503

So Ralph drives Bill up to his ball in front of the green, drops him off and drives over to his ball on the cart path.

"Four men, well along in years, had played golf as a foursome every Sunday morning, until one of them passed away. The other three asked the club pro if he could find them a compatible gentleman to fill out the foursome again. ""No problem,"" answered the pro.     ""But, you have to understand,"" one of the guys, named George, explained, ""that Moe, who died, was like our eyes. We're all getting some cataracts, and have trouble seeing the ball. Moe's eyesight was perfect, and he was our spotter.""     The pro promised to see what he could do, and, when the others returned the following Sunday, he introduced them to a truly ancient looking gentleman, named Gary.     ""How old are you?"" George asked.     ""I'm ninety-four,"" Gary responded.     ""Fabulous,"" said George. ""But how's your eyesight?""     At this, Gary blew up. ""Don't insult my eyes,"" he yelled. ""I may be old, but I've got 20-20 vision. I have eyes like an eagle. Don't insult me!""     ""Okay, okay,"" the others said. ""Let's play golf.""     George was first on the tee, and he hit a long, low drive, that faded significantly after about 200 yards. He turned to Gary.     ""Did you see where it went?"" he asked the ancient one.     ""Did I see where it went? I told you not to insult my eyesight. Of course, I saw where it went. I've got eyes like an eagle!"" Gary yelled.     ""Okay, I'm sorry,"" said George.

"A young man who was also an avid golfer found himself with a few hours to spare one afternoon. He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he could get in 9 holes before he had to head home.    Just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone.    Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him.    To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time.    Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball - and directly between his ball and the green.     After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, ""You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree.""     With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay.     The old man offered one more comment, ""Of course, when I was your age that pine tree was only 3 feet tall.""",Sports,wocka,,297

"New Rules      New Rules  Dear Employee:    As a result of the reduction of money budgeted for department areas, we are forced to cut down on our number of personnel.    Under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. Therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately.    This program will be known as SLAP (Sever Late-Aged Personnel). Employees who are SLAPPED will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company.    SLAPPED employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. This review phase of the program is called SCREW.    SCREW (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers). All employees who have been SLAPPED and SCREWED may file an appeal with upper management.    This appeal is called SHAFT (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination).    Under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be SLAPPED once, SCREWED twice, but may be SHAFTED as many times as the company deems appropriate.    If an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel's Early Severance) or CLAP (Combined Lump sum Assistance Payment).    As HERPES and CLAP are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received HERPES or CLAP will no longer be SLAPPED or SCREWED by the company.    Management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our:    Special High Intensity Training (SHIT). We take pride in the amount of SHIT our employees receive. We have given our employees more SHIT than any company in this area. If any employee feels they do not receive enough SHIT on the job, see your immediate supervisor.    Your supervisor is specially trained to make sure you receive all the SHIT you can stand.

The job was only so-so anyhow.    Next I tried working in a muffler factory, but that was exhausting.    I wanted to be a barber, but I just couldn't cut it.    I attempted to be a deli worker, but any way I sliced it, I couldn't cut the mustard.    My best job was being a musician, but eventually I found I wasn't note worthy.    I studied a long time to become a doctor, but I didn't have any patience.    Next was a job in a shoe factory; I tried, but I just didn't fit in.    I became a professional fisherman, but discovered that I couldn't live on my net income.    I thought about becoming a witch, so I tried that for a spell.    I managed to get a good job working for a pool maintenance company, but the work was just too draining.

"The recent hurricane and gasoline issues helped prove existence of a new element. In early October [2005] a major research institution announced discovery of the heaviest element yet known to science. The new element has been named ""Government.""     Governmentium (Gv) has one neutron, 25 assistant neutrons, 88 deputy neutrons, and 198 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 312.     These 312 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton like particles called peons. Since Gv has no electrons, it is inert. However, it can be detected, because it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. A minute amount of Gv causes one reaction to take over four days to complete, when it would normally take less than a second!     Gv has a normal half-life of 4 years; it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and deputy neutrons exchange places. In fact, Governmentium's mass will actually increase over time, since each reorganization will cause more morons to become neutrons, forming isodopes.     This characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to believe that Gv is formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as Critical Morass.     When catalyzed with money, Gv becomes Administratium (Am) - an element which radiates just as much energy as Gv since it has half as many peons but twice as many morons.",News / Politics,wocka,,338

""Mouse Balls""    Mouse balls are now available as FRU (Field Replacement Units).    Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.    Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls. Ball removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method. Domestic balls are replaced by the twist-off method. Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.    Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse can be used immediately.    It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.

"The US Standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used?   Because that's the way they built them in England, and the US railroads were built by English expatriates. Why did the English people build them like that? Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. Why did ""they"" use that gauge then? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. Why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagons would break on the old long distance roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts. So who built these old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in Europe were built by   Imperial Rome for the benefit of their Legions. The roads have been used ever since. And the ruts? The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots.   Since the chariots were made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. Thus, we have the answer to the original questions. The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches   derives from the original specification for an Imperial Roman army war chariot. Specs and Bureaucracies live forever. So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's behind came up with it, you   may be exactly right. Because the Imperial Roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two warhorses.",Tech,wocka,,384

God was granted a temporary permit for the project, but was stymied with the cease and desist order for the earthly part.     Then God said, ""Let there be light!"" Immediately, the officials demanded to know how the light would be made. Would there be strip mining? What about thermal pollution? God explained that the light would come from a large ball of fire. God was granted provisional permission to make light, assuming that no smoke would result from the ball of fire, and that he would obtain a building permit and to conserve energy, He would have the light out half the time.     God agreed, and offered to call the light ""Day"" and the darkness ""Night"". The officials replied that they were not interested in semantics.     God said, ""Let the earth put forth vegetation, plant yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit."" The EPA agreed, so long as only native seed was used.     Then God said, ""Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth."" The officials pointed out that this would require approval from the Department of Game, coordinated with the Heavenly Wildlife Federation and the Audobon Society.    Everything was okay until God said the project would be completed in six days. The officials said it would take at least two hundred days to review the applications and the impact statement.

In which case, you can renege on the ""overs"".     When your team is about 10 marks down in the 8th or 9th frame, you can invoke the rule ""First Team Through Bowling Wins the Game"", and your team still has a chance.     After a member of the opposing team bowls 4 strikes in a row, he/she must bowl the next 4 frames blindfolded. If he/she continues to strike, his/her shoelaces will be tied together for 2 frames.     When you leave the 10-pin and you know you can't make the spare, but another member of your team can, invoke the ""Designated Bowler"" rule.     After you have 4 splits in one game, you may say ""Kings X"" and take those 4 frames over. However, if you split on the 2nd time around, you accept it. After all, ""Fair is Fair"".     If your ball goes in the gutter and jumps back onto the lane, knocking dow pins, by golly, you get them! That's much harder than to knock them down the conventional way. Good bowling should be recognized.     A ball should be declared dead when you bowl 3 games without a strike.

A robber came into a convenience store wearing a ski mask and a gun wanting to empty the cash register. He took the clerk to the back of the store and locked her up in the fridge. Unfortunately, when he came back to the front of the store, a customer had come in. So he took *off* the ski mask and the gloves, and pretended to be filling in for the clerk. The customer wanted a lottery ticket, so he tried to help her out, pressing a whole bunch of buttons on the machine (thus leaving fingerprints everywhere), but the machine was not cooperating.    Meanwhile, another customer walks in. Finally, he tells the first customer (after about 5 minutes of close-up shots from the camera) that the machine is not working and that he won't be able to help her. The robber *makes the sale* to the second customer and he leaves as well.    The robber then puts back on his gloves to take the money (after touching just about everything in sight *without* gloves), and hides his face with the palm of his hands as he is leaving. This scene lasted well over 10 minutes, during which, you see and hear the robber as well as in a movie.    The day after excerpts of the tape were aired, the phones at the police station were ringing off the hook. Apparently, even though no reward had been offered, people thought he was too stupid to deserve anything else!    He had to turn himself in that same day.",At Work,wocka,,359

"You might remember Zeno's paradox, but in case you don't here it is again. Zeno argued that motion is an illusion. Now, by motion he meant movement, and not the rude kind that involves bowels but the Newtonian kind. He did this by the Achilles (A) and the Tortoise (T) parable. For argument's sake, say A runs 10 times faster than T can crawl. Then let T be placed 10 meters ahead of A at the start of a race. When A has moved 10 meters, T has moved 1 meter, so T is now still 1 meter ahead of A. Then when A has covered that 1 meter, T has gone 1/10 meter ahead. Etc. So, A will never ever pass T. Poor Zeno, it was reported that he found this logic so persuasive that he did not bother to move again, a kind of ontological constipation perhaps?    But the naughty version of it is a bit sexist (feminists, please reverse male and female roles in this story!). It goes like this. A psychologist wanted to test the difference in logical thinking between engineering and mathematics majors, and for this purpose he set up an experiment in which the subjects were respectively a male Mathematics and a randy male Engineering undergraduate. He showed them into the lab. At the far end of the long, narrow room was a luscious semi-clad bimbo. His instructions were like so: ""Fellas, I have in my hands a buzzer that I will sound every minute. Every time I do that, you can walk half the distance that remains between yourself and the lady. Should you ever reach her, you will find her most accommodating. Do you wish to participate in the experimemt?""    Math major: ""You don't fool me. This is the equivalent of the Zeno Paradox, so I am not wasting my time. I am going home, 'Bye."" [Exeunt]  Engineering major: ""Hee, hee! I am staying. I estimate that in 10 minutes, I will be close enough for all practical purposes.""",Tech,wocka,,442

I would die in the first 30 seconds."" He replied, ""I would buy u, just so I could get the achievement of sexy seven.""",Sports,wocka,,124
